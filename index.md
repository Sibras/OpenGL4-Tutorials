# OpenGL Tutorials

This site contains a series of tutorials on computer rendering techniques taught using OpenGL. It contains algorithm descriptions and mathematical details as well as all the programming code required to go from basic windows creation to complex rendering effects. It primarily uses OpenGL 4 (up to feature level 4.4) but also indicates how to implement various effects using OpenGL 3.x if required.

Topics covered include (but not limited to):

- SDL2 window creation
- OpenGL Vertex Arrays (VAO), Vertex Buffers (VBO), Index Buffers (IBO) and Uniform Buffers (UBO)
- Debug call-backs
- FPS style camera
- Point and Spot lighting
- Gouraud and Phong shading
- BRDFs: Blinn-Phong and GGX shaders
- Shader subroutines
- Textures (BMP and compressed KTX)
- Scene/Model loading using Assimp
- Environment mapped refractions
- Real-time dynamic reflections (planar and environment mapped)
- Real-time Shadow mapping (spot and omni-directional point shadows)
- Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) shadows
- Percentage Closer Soft Shadows (PCSS)
- Normal Mapping
- Parallax Occlusion Mapping
- Tessellation shaders (PN triangles)
- Deferred Rendering
- High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Tone Mapping
- Bloom effects
- Horizon Based Ambient Occlusion (HBAO) 
- Volumetric Lighting

These tutorials were created as part of my job but are now made available online in case they may help anyone looking to learn this particular subject matter.
